## Multiplication
If a multiplicand and a multiplier have **m** and **n** digits, the product has at most **m + n** digits
- MIPS-based computers use **32-bit** word for the arithmetic operations
- The product in MIPS-based computers has at most **64 digits**
</br>

### Optimized version of the multiplication HW
- 32-bit multiplicand register / ALU
- 64-bit product register (multiplier shares a register with product)
    - `HI`: most significant 32 bits
    - `LO`: least significant 32 bits
    - Actually, there is one more bit in the left of the product register to hold the carry out of the adder

### Settings
- 0 is stored in the left half of the product register
- The multiplier value is loaded into the right half of the product register
- The multiplicand value is loaded into the multiplicand register
</br>

#### Example
When N = 4 (4-bit ALU / multiplicand, 8-bit product), $2 \times 3$
- should be **repeated as many bits as it is**

### Signed multiplication
Do multiplication after converting both multiplicand & multiplier to positives
- For 31 iterations (except a sign bit)
- After the multiplication, negate the result (if it is required)
Better solution: Booth's Algorithm
- Supports multiplication of two's complement signed numbers in a more efficient way
- Requires almost same hardware with the multiplication of unsigned numbers
</br>

### Instructions
- `mult rs, rt / multu rs, rt` (rs: multiplicand, rt: multiplier)
    - The result (product) is stored in `HI` / `LO`

- `mfhi rd / mflo rd` 
    - Move from `HI` / `LO` to rd

#### Example: `mult $t0, $ t1`
- `$t0` (multiplicand) is used as the Multiplicand register
- Initially, the value in `$t1` (multiplier) is loaded into `LO` register
- Then, do the multiplication and store the 64-bit product to `HI` and `LO` registers
