The assembly language that has been studied so far is not a form that the processor can understand. </br>
Therefore, we need to **encode instructions and data in well-formed binary.**

## Data representation
### numbers
- Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of 1 and 0
- They are considered base 2 numbers (binary numbers)
- Binary numbers are stored in words
- In MIPS, the words are 34 bits (4 bytes) long + MIPS is big endian

### unsigned numbers
- By using n bits, we can represent unsigned numbers from 0 to $2^n-1$

### signed numbers
#### Signed Magnitude
- first bit determines mathematical symbols
    - 0 is plus (+)
    - 1 is minus (-)
- others are bit size
- but, 000 = 100 = 0
#### One's complement
- first bit determines mathematical symbols
    - 0 is plus (+)
    - 1 is minus (-)
- if first bit is 0
    - read it as it is
- if first bit is 1
    - flip 1 to 0, 0 to 1
- ex) 100 = -3
- but, 000 = 111 = 0
#### Two's complement
- first bit determines mathematical symbols
    - 0 is plus (+)
    - 1 is minus (-)
- if first bit is 0
    - read it as it is
- if first bit is 1
    - flip 1 to 0, 0 to 1
    - plus 1
- ex) 100 = -4
- the number of zero is 1

### Answer
**two's complement**  
- we can get the computation result by just doing given arithmetic operations 
    - 000 - 001 = 111 ( 0 - 1 = -1)
    - 010 + 111 = 001 (2 + (-1) = 1)
- the number of zero is only 1.
- by using n bits, we can represent signed numbers from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

#### Signed extension
Sometimes, we need to represent n-bit numbers by using more than n bits
- 16-bit immediate should be converted to 32 bits for arithmetic
- Instructions `lb/lh` loads byte/halfword from memory space and store it into 32-bit registers
- Replicate the sign bit to the left

## Instruction representation
**Like data, instructions are also encoded/represented in binary**</br>
We call the encoded instructions as **machine instructions**</br>

For representing instructions, ISA defines instruction format</br>
Issue: to represent all kinds of instructions, we might need many instrucion formants
</br>

## Design principle 4
### Good design demands good compromise
Based on this, MIPS keeps formats as similar as possible (regularity)

</br>

### R-format
For the instructions that use only Register operands
<center>
<img src="/computer-architecture/2-2/02.jpg"  width="700">
</center>

- `op` (opcode): basic operation of the instruction (what the instruction does)
- `rs`: the first source register operand
- `rt`: the second source register operand
- `rd`: the destination register operand
- `shamt`: shift amount (used for shift operations)
- `funct`: function code (the specific variant of the operation)

Q. why are the rs, rt, rd 5 bits? </br>
A. registers are 32, which means 5 bits are enough to express each register

</br>

### I-format
For the instructions that use Immediate operands
<center>
<img src="/computer-architecture/2-2/03.jpg"  width="700">
</center>

- `op` (opcode): basic operation of the instruction (what the instruction does)
- `rs`: the first source register operand
- `rt`: the second source register operand
- `Constant or address`

## Summary
Key underlying design principles
### Design Principle 1
#### Simplicity favors regularity
All MIPS arithmetic instructions include a single operation & three operands
- Lower clock period or CPI

### Design Principle 2
#### Smaller is faster
Operands of MIPS arithmetic instructions must be chosen in a small number of registers.</br>
MIPS keeps more complex data in memory and supports data transfer between memory and registers.
- Lower clock period or CPI

### Design Principle 3
#### Make the common case fast
Support 16-bit immediate operands for handling small constants + `$zero`
- Lower INstruction count
### Design Principle 4
#### Good design demands goog compromise
Keep all instructions the same length + keep instruction formats similar as possible. </br>
Data (numbers) are also represented in binary based on two's complement rules.
- Lower clock period or CPI
