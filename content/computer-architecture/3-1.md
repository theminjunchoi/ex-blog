## Addition & Subtraction
**Addition**: just do the binary addition with given numbers </br>
**Subtraction**: do the binary addition with the negation of the second operand
### Half adder
1-bit adder without carry-input
- Input: two one bit-data A, B
- Output: sum(S), carry(C)

### Full adder
1-bit adder with carry-input
- Input: two one bit-data A, B, carry(C$_{in}$)
- Output: sum(S), carry(C$_{out}$)

## Circuit design for addition and subtraction
### N-bit parallel binary adder
- Initial carry input is 0
- The i-th adder waits for the carry until it is generated by the (i-1)-th adder

### Adder with subtraction (in two's complement)
- Subtract = 0 or 1 (if subtract == 1, B$_i$ is inverted)
- Subtract is also added as the initial carry (if subtract ==1, 1 is added)

## Overflow
Overflow occurs when computation results are too large (out of range)

### When does it occur?
- Add two positives or negatives + the sign of result is different with sources
- Subtract a negative from a positive + the sign of result is 1
- Subtract a positive from a negative + the sign of result is 0

### How to detect Overflow?
- Use `add, addi, sub` instructions
- They cause exceptions on overflow
    - A program jumps to predefined exception handler address
- e.g., Fortran does not allow overflows. So MIPS Fortran compilers always use `add, addi, sub`

### How to ignore Overflow? 
- Use `addu, addui, subu` instructions (u means unsigned)
- They do not cause exceptions on overflow
- e.g., C ignores overflows. So MIPS C compilers always use `addu, addui, subu`
