## Pipelined datapath
We need registers between stages **to hold information produced in previous stage and make isolation**

## Data hazards
When an instruction depends on the completion of data access by a previous instruction, it causes data hazards.

### How to detect & when to forward
- **Step 1: Pass register numbers along pipeline**
    - if I-format or branch instruction, Rd is invalid value
- **Step 2: Check the following data hazard conditions**
    - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`
    - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`
    - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`
    - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`
- **Step 3: If there is a data hazard, then do forwarding**
    - But only if the forwarding instruction writes to a register
        - Check the RegWrite signal in `EX/MEM.RegWrite` and `MEM/WB.RegWrite` is `1`
    - And only if Rd for the forwarding instruction is not `$zero`
        - `$zero` cannot be overwritten
        - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0`
        - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd != 0`

- **EX hazards**
    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`) <Br>**ForwardA = 10**
    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`) <Br>**ForwardB = 10**
- **MEM hazard**
    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`) <Br>**ForwardA = 01**
    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`) <Br>**ForwardB = 01**
- **Both EX & MEM hazards**
    - Use the most recent result **(the result in EX/MEM)**

## Load-use data hazards
But, sometimes, we cannot avoid stalls by forwarding<br>
We need to stall for one cycle when we have to forward the data from MEM/WB registers to ALU stage

</center>

### How to detect & when to forward
- **Step 1: Check the following condition**
    - `ID/EX.MemRead == 1 &&` <br>`(ID/EX.RegisterRt == IF/ID.RegisterRs || ID/EX.RegisterRt == IF/ID.RegisterRt)`
- **Step 2: If detect, stall**
    - Prevent PC and IF/ID from changing<br>the same instruction is executed in IF & ID stages
    - Insert `nop` in the EX stage by setting the control signals in ID/EX register to 0
    - `PCWrite = 0`, `IF/IDWrite = 0` (if no load-use data hazards, they are 1)

### Code scheduling 
Reorder code to avoid the load-use data hazards (done by compiler)
#### Algorithm
- Check the existence of load hazards
    - A load hazard occurs when the destination register of a load instruction is used as a source register of its next instruction
- If exists, check whether there is a code that can ve executed after the load instruction
    - This reordering must not change the result of the program, while solving hazard
    - We must consider the instruction dependencies
<br>

## Control hazards
If branch outcome is determined in a MEM stage, there will be three pipeline bubbles

### How to process
- **Simple solution: static branch prediction**
    - Predict that the branch will not be taken (just the next instruction will be executed)
    - If the prediction is correct, there will be no pipeline stall
    - If the prediction is incorrect, flush 3 instructions and insert 3 pipeline bubbles
- **Improving by early comparison in ID stage**
    - Use same prediction
    - If the prediction is correct, there will be no pipeline stall
    - If the prediction is incorrect, flush 1 instruction and insert 1 pipeline bubble
- **Dynamic branch prediction**
    - History-based prediction with BPT(branch prediction table), store a recent branch decision (taken / not taken)
    - Indexed by branch instruction addresses
<br>

### Dynamic branch prediction
Make a better branch prediction in a way to reduce the number of misprediction
- Step 1: access a branch prediction table by using the instruction address
- Step 2: Check the prediction value in the table and fetch the next (not taken) or target branch instruction (taken)
- Step 3: If the prediction is wrong, flush pipeline and flip prediction

#### 2-bit predictor
Only change prediction on two successive mispredictions

#### Branch target buffer
Still, we should experience 1 pipeline stall to compute the target address for a taken branch
- Cache of target address
- Indexed by the address of branch instructions
- When a branch instruction is fetched and its prediction is "taken", <br>then check the branch target buffer
    - If there is a target address, fetch the target immediately
