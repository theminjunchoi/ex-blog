## Code scheduling
There are three types of critical dependencies
- Read after write
- Write after read
- Write after write
If two instructions have one of the above dependencies,<br>
**the execution order these two instructions must be maintained**

## Exceptions
### Exceptions VS Interrupts in MIPS
- Exception: arises within the CPU (internally)
- Interrupt: from an external I/O controller (externally)

| Type of event | From where | MIPS terminology |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| I/O device request | External | Interrupt |
| Invoke OS from a user program | Internal | Exception |
| Arithmetic overflow | Internal | Exception |
| Using an undefined instruction | Internal | Exception |
| HW malfunctions | Either | Exception or interrupt |
<br>

### How to handle
- Step 1: Save the address of the offending instruction in the EPC (Exception Program Counter)
    - EPC is a 32-bit register
- Step 2: Save the reason for the exception in the Cause register
    - Cause is a 32-bit register (some bits are unused)
- Step 3: Jump to the exception handler corresponds to the cause
    - The handler address for undefined opcode: $8000\;0000_{hex}$
    - Overflow: $8000\;0180_{hex}$
    - But sometimes without saving the reason for the exception, it jumps to the exception handler
- Step 4: Do actions
    - Read the cause and determine the action required
    - If recoverable, take a corrective action and use EPC to return to a program
    - Otherwise, terminate the program and report error using EPC, cause, ...

### Exceptions according to the stage
Exceptions can occur in any stage (except WB)
- IF: Invalid memory access (memory fault)
    - e.g., when PC holds an invalid memory address value
- ID: Undefined instruction
    - e.g., `abc $t0, $t1, $t2`
- EX: Overflow
    - e.g., when we use add, addi, and sub instructions
- MEM: Invalid memory access (memory fault)
    - e.g., when a computed target memory address is abnormal
Regardless of the stage, the cause of exceptions is stored in the Cause register<br>
Then, guess which instruction caused the exception based on the cause
<br>

### Multiple exceptions
Multiple instructions are executed in different stages at the same time, which means multiple exceptions can occur in the same clock cycle.
#### How to prioritize multiple exceptions?
- In MIPS, earliest instruction first
- Flush subsequent instructions
