## Procedures
### Functions in a program
Procedures do calling / returning with other procedures
- A procedure (caller) calls another procedure (callee)
- The callee returns values to caller

### Calling / returning process
1. The caller passes input arguments and the return address to the callee
2. The caller transfers control to the callee
3. The callee performs its operations with the given input arguments
4. The callee passes the return values to the caller
5. The callee transfers control to the caller (Return to the given return address)
6. The caller restores the saved things

### The way to pass values
Use registers for passing arguments, return address, and return values

But, what if different procedures share the same registers? </br>
**Use stacks to store all the information for operating each procedure** </br>
Stacks are kept in memory
- The register `$sp` points the top-of-stack in memory
- By convention, stack grows towards lower addresses

### Register saving
The values of some registers must be preserved on call </br>
It must be possible to recover the values on those registers after calling / returning is completed

If a callee uses preserved registers, the callee must
- Save the values of the registers on its stack **after calling**
- Restore the saved values **before returning**

If a caller needs to keep the values in non-preserved registers, the caller must
- Save the values on its stack **before calling**
- Restore the saved values **after returning**

</br>

## Instructions for procedure calls

**`jal PROCEDURE_LABEL`**
- The return address of a caller (the address of following instruction) put in `$ra`
- Jump to the target address (`PROCEDURE_LABEL`)

**`jr $ra`**
- Jump to the address stored in `$ra` (other registers can also be used as an operand)
</br>

**Push**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code class="prose-code:text-yellow-400
            prose-code:text-sm 
            prose-code:font-normal">addi $sp, $sp, -4
sw $t0, 0($sp)
</code></pre>
- Push the data stored in `$t0` into the top-of-stack 


**Pop**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code class="prose-code:text-yellow-400
            prose-code:text-sm 
            prose-code:font-normal">lw $t0, 0($sp)
addi $sp, $sp, 4
</code></pre>
- Pop the data stored in top-of-stack and store it to `$t0`

## MIPS memory allocation
### local data
During the procedure call, both registers and local variables are stored on stack. </br>
Wer call the segment of the stack 'activation record' or 'procedure frame'
- The frame pointer (`$fp`) points to the first word of the frame
- During the execution of a procedure, `$fp` is stable. So, it is used to reference variables
