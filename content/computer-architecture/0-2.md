### Below your program
A simplified view of hardware and software
- **Applications software**
    - Written in high-level language
- **Systems software**
    - **Compilers**: translate high-level language to machine language
    - **Operating Systems**
        - Handle input/output operations
        - Manage resources (e.g., storage, memory)
        - Schedule tasks (processes)
- **Hardware**
    - processors memory, I/O devices
</br>


## Execution of programs
**Step 1: Translating language**
- From high-level language
    - Designed for specific domain
    - Provides for productivity and portability
- To hardware machine language
    - Binary digits
    - Encoded instructions
</br>

**Step 2: Inputting, outputting, processing, and storing data with 4 fundamental HW components**

</center>

- Processor
    - Datapath + control, our primary focus
- Memory
- Input device
    - Keyboard, mouse, ...
- Output device
    - Screen, speaker
</br>

1) Loading: programs are stored in memory
2) Inputting: input device write data to memory
3) Fetching: processor fetches instructions and data from memory
4) Decoding: processor (control) decodes the instructions and determine what to do
5) Executing : processor (datapath) executes the instructions & stores the computation result to memory
6) Outputting: output device sends the result by reading output data from memory

## Understanding program performance
- Algorithm 
    - Determines the number of operations executed
- Programming language, compiler, and instruction set architecture (ISA)
    - Determine the number of machine instructions executed per operation
- Processor and memory system
    - Determine how fast instructions can be executed
- I/O system (including OS)
    - Determines how fast I/O operations are executed
</br>

## What is ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
- An interface between SW snd HW (includes a set of machine instruction)
    - SW is translated into the machine instructions included in the ISA
    - HW is designed to support the instructions in ISA
</br>

## 8 great ideas for designing better computer architecture
- Design for **Moore's Law**
    - Anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes
- Provide **abstraction** to simplify design
    - Hide low-level details for the ease of SW development
- Make **the common case** fast
    - Enhance performance of the common case instead of optimizing the rare case.
- Perform via **parallelism**
    - Perform operations in parallel
- Performance via **pipelining**
    - Use a particular patten of parallelism, called pipelining
- Performance via **prediction**
    - Start working with prediction, stead of waiting until you know for sure
- **Hierarchy** of memories
    - Use the fastest, smallest, and most expensive memory at the top of the hierarchy and the slowest, largest, and cheapest memory at the bottom
    - cache > RAM > Large SSD 
- Dependability via **redundancy**
    - Include redundant components that can take over when failure occurs
