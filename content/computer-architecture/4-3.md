A single-cycle datapath executes instructions in one clock cycle with a clocking methodology. </br>
We will study how this works according to instructions

R-format

- don't need to access memory
    - `MemRead` = 0
    - `MemtoReg` = 0
    - `MemWrite` = 0
- have to update value of `rd` register
    - `RegDst` = 1
    - `RegWrite` = 1
- PC just have to be updated +4
    - `branch` = 0
- ALU control determines the arithmetic type according to `ALUOp` and `func code` of instruction

- need to access memory and read data
    - `MemRead` = 1
    - `MemtoReg` = 1
    - `MemWrite` = 0
- have to get value from memory to `rs` field (destination)
    - `RegDst` = 0 (`rs` to destination)
    - `RegWrite` = 1
- PC just have to be updated +4
    - `branch` = 0
- ALU control determines the arithmetic type according to `ALUOp`
- offset is extended from 16-bit to 32-bit by Sign-extend unit and added with Read data 1 (base addr)
</br>

### Branch-on-equal

- don't need to access memory
    - `MemRead` = 0
    - `MemtoReg` = 0
    - `MemWrite` = 0
- Calculate target address
    - extend the offset to 32 bit and shift left twice (multiply 4)
    - add with `PC + 4`
- `RegDst` doesn't matter
</br>

Jump
</center>

- Calculate target address
    - offset is extended to 28-bit
    - concatenate with `0000`
- `Jump signal = 1`
