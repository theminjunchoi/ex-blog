## Case
I will focus on handling a subset of core MIPS instructions (MIPS subset)
- The arithmetic-logical instructions: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`
- The memory-reference instructions: `lw`, `sw`
- The conditional instructions: `beq`, `jump`

## Logic design basics
In the MIPS implementation, the datapath elements consist of
- **Combinational** elements
    - Operate on data values
    - Given inputs, a combinational element produces outputs
    - e.g., ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit), Adder, Multiplexer, AND-gate
- **State (sequential)** elements
    - Contain state
    - They have some internal storage
    - e.g., instruction and data memory, registers
</br>

Combinational elements work with state elements
- Getting inputs from state elements
- Giving outputs to state elements

## Clocking methodology
When data can be read and written is determined relative to the clock </br>
In this book, we assume **"Positive edge-triggered clocking methodology"**

Combinational elements works with state elements </br>
**In a single clock cycle = between clock edges = between rising edges**
- At one rising edge, combinational elements read inputs from state elements
- Before the next rising edge, combinational elements complete operations and produce outputs
- At the next rising edge, state elements are updated with the outputs
- **The longest delay determines clock period**

### State elements with two inputs
**State elements (e.g., registers) take two inputs: update data and a clock signal** </br>
Based on the clock signal, it is determined when to update the data 

In positive edge-triggered clocking methodology, </br>
Update the data at rising edges (when the clock signal changes from 0 to 1)

### State elements with three inputs
**State elements take three inputs: update data and a clock signal with write control** </br>
Based on the clock signal and the write control, it is determined when to update the data

In positive edge-triggered clocking methodology, </br>
Update the data at rising edges + **when the write control input is 1**
