## MIPS memory allocation
To avoid the overlap for managing memory, we use stack, heap, and static space.

### Stack
During the procedure call, both registers and local variables are stored on stack. </br>
We call the segment of the stack **activation record** or **procedure frame**
- The frame pointer (`$fp`) points to the first word of the frame
- During the execution of a procedure, `$fp` is stable. So, it is used to reference variables

- **Activation record**
    - managed in a stack from high address to low address

### Heap
- **Dynamically-allocated data**
    - managed in a heap from low addresses to high addresses

### Static space
- **Global variables**
    - assigned a fixed address
    - statically allocated
    - all reference to a global variable point to the same object
    - it cannot be stored in an activation record

</br>

### Code & Data in memory

These addresses are only a software convention, and not part of the MIPS architecture.
- The stack pointer (`$sp`) is initialized to `7fff fffc`$_{hex}$ and grows down toward the data segment
- At the other end, the program code starts at `0040 0000`$_{hex}$
    - From `0000 0000`$_{hex}$ to `0040 0000`$_{hex}$ is just reserved
- The static data starts at `1000 0000`$_{hex}$
- The global pointer (`$gp`) is set to an address to make it easy to access data, and initialized to to `1000 8000`$_{hex}$ so that it can access fromm `1000 0000`$_{hex}$ to `1000 ffff`$_{hex}$ using the positive and negative 16-bit offsets from `$gp`
- Dynamic data is grows up toward the stack in an area called heap
</br>

## Addressing mode 
After we decode instructions, we will perform corresponding tasks. </br>
At this time, we need to **access data or instructions which can be stored in instructions, registers or memory.**

### 1. Immediate addressing (with immediate operands)
- by decoding instructions, we can get data **directly**
- last 16 bits are used to represent data
- the operand is 16 bits of the instructions
- don't need to access other place

#### Supporting 32-bit constants
Sometimes, we need to use a 32-bit constants
- `lui` instruction
    - transfers the 16 bit immediate constant field value into the leftmost 16 bits of the register
    - fills the lower 16 bits with `0`s
- `ori` instruction
    - fills the lower 16 bits with given data
</br>

### 2. Register addressing (with register operands)
- use 5 bits to represent register number from 0 to 31
    - because there are 32 registers
- work like a pointer

### 3. Base addressing (with data transfer instructions) 
- `rs` points base address, and last 16 bits represent offset
- 16 bits can represent from `-2`$^{15}$ to `2`$^{15}$`-1`
    - `2`$^{15}$ = `8000`$_{hex}$
    - `$gp` always points `1000 8000`$_{hex}$ which means that, with offset it can access every statically-allocated space

### 4. PC-relative addressing (with branch instructions)
- there is no base address like data transfer instructions
- Assumption: most branch targets are near from the current instruction
- In HW implementation, `PC` is already incremented by 4 before computing the current instruction
    - `PC` points next instructions
- all instructions are stored in an address that is a multiple of 4.
    - by alignment restrictions, it ends with last 2 bits `00`
    - it increments by 4 which is `00`
    - it always ends with `00`
- to save space, MIPS does not store last 2 bits
    - to calculate offset, we have to multiply by 4
    - actually it can represent up to 18 bits
    - 18 bits can represent from `PC-2`$^{17}$ to `PC+2`$^{17}$`-4`

### 5. Pseudo-direct addressing (with branch instructions)
- if branch targets are far from the current instruction (over 16 bits)
- last 26 bits are used to represent the address of label
- skip last 2 bits like PC-relative addressing
    - actually it can represent up to 28 bits
- code is stored from `0040 0000`$_{hex}$ to `1000 0000`$_{hex}$
    - `1000 0000`$_{hex}$ = `0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000`$_{2}$
    - which means that we have to access up to `0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100`$_{2}$
        - always start with `0000`$_{2}$
        - other 28 bits is important
- So, with 26 bits we can represent up to 28 bits and concatenate `0000`$_{2}$ to the front
